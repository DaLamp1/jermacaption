The bot supports:
- **Unicode Characters**: Full Unicode support including emojis
- **Discord Emojis**: Custom Discord emojis are rendered properly
- **Long Text**: Automatic text wrapping and sizing
- **Special Characters**: Safe handling of HTML entities

## Queue Status Messages

When the bot is busy, you'll see status messages:

- `üîÑ Processing your request...` - Your GIF is being generated
- `‚è≥ Your request is in the queue! Position: X/Y` - Waiting in line
- `‚ö†Ô∏è The queue is currently full. Please try again later.` - Queue at capacity
- `‚ö†Ô∏è You have too many requests in the queue.` - User limit reached
- `‚ö†Ô∏è You're sending requests too quickly!` - Rate limit hit

## Tips for Best Results

### Text Guidelines
- Keep text concise for better readability
- Use line breaks for longer messages
- Avoid excessive special characters
- Consider the GIF's aspect ratio when writing text

### Performance Tips
- Popular GIFs may have longer queue times
- Try different GIFs if one is heavily used
- Shorter text processes faster
- Use the autocomplete feature to find GIFs quickly

### Troubleshooting
- If a request fails, try again with shorter text
- Check that your message contains actual text (not just emojis)
- Wait a moment between requests to avoid rate limiting
- Contact server admins if the bot appears unresponsive
